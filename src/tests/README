This is the short summary of what needs to be done to use this test suite.
More detailed instructions are contained in the `TESTS' file in the topplevel
of this source distribution.



REGENERATING THE TEST SUITE
***************************

This package must be configured with the `--enable-maintainer-mode' option to
allow rebuilding of the test suite.  Please see the `INSTALL' file at the
toplevel of this source distribution and the `TESTS' file in the same directory
for more.

The distributed Bourne shell script should still be useful to those who simply
want to test their system and do not need to alter the test suite.



RUNNING THE TEST SUITE
**********************

To run from this directory:

	$ ./suite AUTOTEST_PATH=src

To run from any directory with a working CVS or to test the first executable
named `cvs' in $PATH:

	$ suite

For more info on running tests:

	$ suite --help
