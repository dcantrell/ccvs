This test suite currently requires the development version of Autoconf to be
regenerated.  The distributed Bourne shell script should still be useful to
those who simply want to test their system and do not need to alter the test
suite.

To run from this directory:

	$ ./suite AUTOTEST_PATH=src

To run from any directory with a working cvs or to test the first executable
named `cvs' in $PATH:

	$ suite

For more info:

	$ suite --help
